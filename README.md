keep in mind that, always start your project with a blueprint, with a gist, it means you need to know what you want to do.
1-create Firebase Project in the google firebase
2-create web app within firebase to get config value
3 install firebase inside your project by npm install firebase
4-create a config inside your project and name it firebase.config.js
5- Add authentication to email and password and Google OAth
6- Create a user from firebase to test authentication
7-Enable fire store
8-Add rules for firestroe
9-Enable storage
10-Add rules fro storage
11-create 4 composite indexes for advanced querying,.
////////////////////////
have it in your mind, once you have created the file, you will be directed to your dashboard.
we have two types of database, 1- Real time database=> which is a database that firebase use.

///Bellow You can see how google geolocation works
Google Geocoding is a service provided by Google that allows developers to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and vice versa. The service uses a combination of geospatial data and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and up-to-date location information.

With Google Geocoding, developers can use the geocoded information to display locations on maps, calculate distances between locations, and perform various location-based analyses. The service is particularly useful for applications that require real-time location information, such as ride-hailing, food delivery, and e-commerce.

To use the Google Geocoding service, developers need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console and make HTTP requests to the Geocoding API endpoint. The API supports both forward geocoding (converting addresses to geographic coordinates) and reverse geocoding (converting geographic coordinates to addresses).

Here's an example of how to use the Google Geocoding API to convert an address to geographic coordinates using JavaScript:

```javascript
const apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
const address = "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA";

fetch(
  `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=${address}&key=${apiKey}`
)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    const location = data.results[0].geometry.location;
    console.log(`Latitude: ${location.lat}, Longitude: ${location.lng}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

In the above example, the code makes a fetch request to the Geocoding API endpoint with the address and API key as parameters. The response is parsed as JSON, and the latitude and longitude of the location are retrieved from the response data.

Google Geocoding is a powerful tool for developers who need to work with location data in their applications. It provides accurate and up-to-date location information, and its simple API makes it easy to integrate with web and mobile applications.
