Firebase=> it is an all in one platfrom/ we can get databases, we can get authentications, file storage=> since we will going to upload images.

we need to create a firebase project and give it a nock name. it will then give us some infomraiton about api key and project ocnfiguration. then we need to get into the root direcotry of the project and create a file called firebase.config.js... then we need to copy the given information within the created file.

next step we need to enable authenticaiton within the project. we need to add Google OAth.
go to authentication and get started and then choose you intended provider.
enable that and add new provider and choose google anmd enable that and change public facing name and click save.
next to test the authentication we need to creat a user.
when you go to authentixation you will see all your users. all your users that signup thorough your applcaiton. when you add user, it will automatically give you an id. this id later will be used thorugh listing,
next step is yo enable firestore within the prioject,.

now we need to got to fire store and create a listing.
a document is just an item is just a record. each document has got a unique documetn id.
